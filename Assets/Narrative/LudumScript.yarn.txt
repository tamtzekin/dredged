Okay.
-> —Where am I. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
Let's start again.
-> —What is this about? 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
Here, can you take a seat?
-> —Sure. ['1']
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —I’m already sitting down. ['2'] 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
It's good to have you back. What is your name?
-> —S. ['1'] 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —B. ['2'] 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemLie>>
You didn’t say that last time. Tell me again, what’s your name?
-> —S. ['1']
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —B. ['2'] 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemLie>>
Let's just move on. Tell me about the first time you met Riley.
-> —Who? 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardLie>>
-> —Okay. What do you want to know? 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
When did you meet them?
-> —There were a couple of times.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemLie>>
-> —I only met Riley once.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
Did you speak to them? 
-> —Yes.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —No. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemBigLie>>
Try to remember for me. Did you?
-> —Yes.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —No. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardLie>>
Good. So, do you know where B. is now?
-> —Yes.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —He's with you. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
What did Riley do to B.?
-> —I never found out. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemBigLie>>
-> —Took him away.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
B. has trouble breathing now. That's what you told me last time we went through this.
-> —...
Has B. been having trouble breathing?
-> —Yes. I told you this. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardLie>>
-> —No. That's wrong.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
Okay. Then, can I set the scene for you? It might help?
-> —...
When B. was found he was stuggling to breathe. He said Riley said it was payback for what you did. 
-> —Payback...
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
First, the rash. Then, the sleep. Not being able to sleep. And third...
-> —Third was the breathing. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardLie>> 
-> —Third was his eyes.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
That's right. You remember now. 
-> —I remember.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
B. moved all his money and the shared assets you and he had to a bank account offshore. Did this happen before or after you met Riley?
-> —Before. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemBigLie>>
-> —After
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
And had you met Riley before?
-> —Just a few times. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemBigLie>>
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
-> —I've only met Riley once.
Was it you, or was it Riley?
-> —...
I'm sorry. Sorry to dwell on it. It's horrible. Did you do this to B., or did Riley do this?
-> —I did it. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardTruth>>
-> —Riley.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
What did Riley do to B.?
-> —Riley killed him. 
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemAwkwardLie>> 
-> —Riley took him away.
	<<addItem DispenserInventory ItemTruth>>
And so when we found B. sitting on the side of the road – I mean, he wouldn't even talk to us, he wouldn't even tell us where he'd been –  you're saying that
